            You might have seen challenges like drawing a certain amount of
            boxes. Or heard people recommend drawing boxes as a warm up or as a
            habit. Its a really useful skill as you can represent anything in
            low fidelity using boxes and cylinders. This page helps you out with
            learning how to do stuff. Using boxes to draw something is a great
            start, but the next step is to draw that thing in different angles
            and positions to really learn it and lock it in your arsenal. Once
            you can draw it in any angle you want, you can use it in your
            drawings easier.

                software if you really wanted to. buts its conveniant to have it
