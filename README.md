## About

Improve your perspective knowledge by understanding how to rotate
shapes in 3D space. I offer no secrets here; to progress you will
have to put in work.

"You can't draw what you don't know." is something you probably have heard already, but rarely is it applied to perspective.

How are you meant to know what a box looks like in all the different angles and positions if you haven't seen it before?

- Journey aims to help you learn perspective through challenges.
- Freeview is a model viewer that will allow you to transform the model in various ways and then practice rotating it in 3D space.

## Built with

- Next.JS
- React
- ShadCn
- TailwindCSS
- React Three Fiber
- pmndrs/drei

## Status

The main features have been implemented, and there is more to come.

If you find bugs or have a feature you want added, then you can create an issue.

You can also create pull requests.
